# Messaging and Profile Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of in-app messaging, account deletion, password reset improvements, and profile visibility features for the PickleRadar app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. In-App Messaging System

#### Database Schema
- Created `messages` table with the following structure:
  - `id`: UUID primary key
  - `sender_id`: UUID reference to users table
  - `recipient_id`: UUID reference to users table
  - `content`: Text content of the message
  - `read`: Boolean flag for read status
  - `created_at`: Timestamp
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- Users can view messages they sent or received
- Users can send messages to any user
- Users can update messages they received (mark as read)
- Users can delete their own messages

#### New Screens
1. **Messages Tab** (`app/(tabs)/messages.tsx`)
   - Lists all conversations with other users
   - Shows unread message count
   - Displays last message preview
   - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
   - Search functionality to filter conversations

2. **Conversation Screen** (`app/conversation/[id].tsx`)
   - One-on-one chat interface
   - Real-time message updates
   - Message read receipts
   - Date separators for better organization
   - Keyboard-aware scrolling
   - Auto-scroll to latest messages

#### Navigation Updates
- Added "Messages" tab to the bottom navigation bar
- Tab icon: message/chat icon
- Positioned between "Friends" and "Profile" tabs

### 2. Account Deletion

#### Implementation
- Added "Delete Account" button in profile page
- Two-step confirmation process:
  1. Initial warning dialog explaining permanence
  2. Confirmation with detailed consequences

#### Data Deletion
- Deletes user record from `users` table
- Cascading deletes handle related data:
  - Check-ins
  - Friend relationships
  - Messages (sent and received)
  - Notifications
  - User-submitted courts
- Attempts to delete auth user (requires admin privileges)
- Signs user out after deletion
- Redirects to welcome screen

#### User Experience
- Clear warning about permanent deletion
- Explains all data that will be lost
- Disabled during deletion process
- Success confirmation after completion

### 3. Password Reset Improvements

#### Deep Linking
- Updated password reset email to use deep link: `pickleball://reset-password`
- This ensures users are redirected back to the app after clicking the reset link

#### New Reset Password Screen
- Created `app/reset-password.tsx` for handling password updates
- Features:
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Confirm password field
  - Password strength tips
  - Session validation
  - Error handling for expired links

#### User Flow
1. User requests password reset from auth screen
2. Receives email with reset link
3. Clicks link → Opens app to reset password screen
4. Enters new password with confirmation
5. Password updated → Redirected to home screen

### 4. Profile Visibility Based on Friendship Status

#### Friend Profiles (Full Access)
When viewing a friend's profile, users can see:
- Full name and nickname
- Profile picture
- Check-in history
- Member since date
- All stats (check-ins, skill level, DUPR)
- "Send Message" button
- "Remove Friend" button

#### Non-Friend Profiles (Limited Access)
When viewing a non-friend's profile, users can only see:
- First name and last initial only
- Skill level
- DUPR rating
- Privacy notice badge
- "Add Friend" button

#### Privacy Notice
- Displays a badge indicating limited profile view
- Encourages adding as friend to see more information
- Uses lock icon for visual clarity

#### Read-Only Display
- All profile information is read-only for other users
- Only the profile owner can edit their own information
- Clear visual distinction between view and edit modes

### 5. Additional Improvements

#### Message Button on Friend Profiles
- Added "Send Message" button on friend profiles
- Directly opens conversation with that friend
- Positioned prominently above "Remove Friend" button

#### Real-Time Updates
- Messages update in real-time using Supabase subscriptions
- Conversation list refreshes when new messages arrive
- Unread counts update automatically

#### Type Safety
- Added `Message` interface to types
- Updated Supabase types to include messages table
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Technical Details

### Database Indexes
Created indexes for optimal query performance:
- `idx_messages_sender_id` on `messages(sender_id)`
- `idx_messages_recipient_id` on `messages(recipient_id)`
- `idx_messages_created_at` on `messages(created_at DESC)`

### Security Considerations
1. **RLS Policies**: All message operations are protected by RLS
2. **Privacy**: Non-friends cannot see sensitive information
3. **Account Deletion**: Permanent and irreversible with clear warnings
4. **Password Reset**: Secure token-based flow with session validation

### User Experience Enhancements
1. **Loading States**: All async operations show loading indicators
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for all operations
3. **Confirmations**: Important actions require user confirmation
4. **Real-Time**: Instant updates for messages and conversations
5. **Search**: Easy to find conversations and users

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `app/(tabs)/messages.tsx` - Messages list screen
- `app/conversation/[id].tsx` - Individual conversation screen
- `app/reset-password.tsx` - Password reset screen
- `MESSAGING_AND_PROFILE_UPDATES.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added messages tab
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added delete account functionality
- `app/user/[id].tsx` - Implemented privacy-based profile visibility
- `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Added updatePassword function, improved reset flow
- `types/index.ts` - Added Message interface
- `app/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Added messages table types

### Database Migrations
