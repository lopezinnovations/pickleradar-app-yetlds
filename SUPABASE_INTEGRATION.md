## Authentication

### Email/Password Authentication
- Sign up with email verification required
- Email redirect URL: https://natively.dev/email-confirmed
- Automatic user profile creation on signup
- Session persistence with AsyncStorage

### Features
- Auto-refresh tokens
- Persistent sessions
- Email verification required
- Password reset support (via Supabase)

## App Integration

### Client Configuration
Location: `app/integrations/supabase/client.ts`

The Supabase client is configured with:
- AsyncStorage for session persistence
- Auto-refresh tokens enabled
- TypeScript types for type safety

### Custom Hooks

#### useAuth
Location: `hooks/useAuth.ts`

Features:
- User authentication state management
- Sign up with email verification
- Sign in with password
- Sign out
- Update user profile
- Automatic profile fetching

#### useCourts
Location: `hooks/useCourts.ts`

Features:
- Fetch all courts
- Calculate activity levels based on check-ins
- Real-time player counts
- Fallback to mock data if not configured

#### useCheckIn
Location: `hooks/useCheckIn.ts`

Features:
- Check in at a court with skill level
- Check out from a court
- Get user's current check-in
- Automatic expiration after 3 hours
- Prevents duplicate check-ins

#### useFriends
Location: `hooks/useFriends.ts`

Features:
- Fetch friends list
- Fetch pending friend requests
- Send friend requests by email
- Accept/reject friend requests
- Remove friends
- See which friends are currently playing

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies:
- Users can only access their own data
- Courts are publicly viewable
- Check-ins are visible to calculate activity but user-specific operations are restricted
- Friend relationships are only visible to involved users

### Data Privacy
- User check-ins are aggregated anonymously for activity levels
- Friend visibility is opt-in only
- Location data is optional and only used for nearby court suggestions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Push Notifications**
   - Friend check-in notifications
   - Nearby court activity alerts
   - Friend request notifications

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Live court activity updates
   - Real-time friend status
   - Instant check-in notifications

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Court ratings and reviews
   - Game scheduling
   - Tournament organization
   - Player statistics

4. **Subscription System**
   - Premium features
   - Ad-free experience
   - Advanced analytics

## Development Notes

### Testing
- Mock data is available when Supabase is not configured
- All hooks check for configuration before making API calls
- Graceful fallbacks for offline/error scenarios

### Database Maintenance
- Expired check-ins can be cleaned up using the `delete_expired_check_ins()` function
- Consider setting up a cron job to run this function periodically

### Type Safety
- TypeScript types are auto-generated from the database schema
- Types are located in `app/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- Regenerate types after schema changes using Supabase CLI

## Support
