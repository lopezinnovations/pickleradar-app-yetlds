## What You Need to Do (Supabase Dashboard)

### Required: Update Email Templates

You need to manually update the email templates in Supabase Dashboard.

**📄 See:** `EMAIL_TEMPLATE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for complete HTML templates

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select project: `biczbxmaisdxpcbplddr`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Email Templates**
4. Update "Confirm signup" template (copy from guide)
5. Update "Reset password" template (copy from guide)
6. Save both templates

**Templates Include:**
- PickleRadar logo/branding (🎾 emoji for now, can be replaced with image)
- Styled buttons
- Success messages
- "Powered by Lopez Innovations LLC" footer

2. Create API key
3. Verify sender email
4. In Supabase: **Project Settings** → **Auth** → **SMTP Settings**
5. Enable "Custom SMTP"
6. Configure:
   - Host: `smtp.sendgrid.net`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: `apikey`
   - Password: [Your SendGrid API Key]
   - Sender email: [Your verified email]
   - Sender name: `PickleRadar`
